Create a program that figures out the number of letter A that is added to words given below.

There should be 2 A's between each letter, including before and after the word.
If there already is 1 A's between two letters, only 1 A should be added.
If there already are 2 A's between two letters, no additional A's should be added.

Assume word is at least 2 letters long, and has no more than 2 consecutive A's.

Examples:

me = aamaaeaa = 6 A's added

hey = aahaaeaayaa = 8 A's added

man = aamaanaa = 5 A's added

naan = aanaanaa = 4 A's added
